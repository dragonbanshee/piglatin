# piglatin
A Pig Latin translator written in Python. 

<h1>Installing Python</h1>
<strong>Note: This will only work on Python 3.x</strong>

Go here and get Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once that is done, install it and make sure it is in your path. Once that is done, we will move to the next step.


<h1>Compiling/Running</h1>
<strong>Note: For this project I used <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a> to write and compile it, but you can use whatever one you like the best.<strong>
<u>This section will be written with the assumption that you are using NetBeans.</u>
First (assuming you have NetBeans already downloaded and installed properly), you will need to follow the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/Python">instructions for installing Python</a> found at that link. Once that is done, open up NetBeans, go to File->Open File, and choose the piglatin.py file. Once that is open, <strong>make sure you click once in the code section so that section is selected</strong, then either hit the F6 key (default), or just click on the green triangle (play button) in the upper toolbar, to the right of the two hammers. 

Once you have run it, the output will be shown at the bottom of the window where it says "Output". <strong>Make sure you have that section selected or the word you type in will be put into your code where the cursor was last</strong>, then type in whatever word you want translated and hit enter. If you want to try again, type "y", if not, type "n".
